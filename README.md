# Covestro_Hackathon
Raw Code for the Covestro Hackathon, to develop an Automated Model for Particle Formation Quality

The model developement involved Image Preprocessing as a primary step.
The second step involved construction of an Artifical Neural Network for Feature Extraction.
Ultimate aim of the Hackathon project was to predict the image quality, as put for by Quality Managers at Covestro.
The quality of model would be determined by adjusted R^2 value.
